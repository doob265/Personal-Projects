This folder contains my various Java projects. The standalone baseball.java file is my first attempt at making a baseball simulator. It is entirely text-based and is no longer being updated. The BaseballFX folder is my second attempt at making a baseball simulator. This one uses JavaFX to output to a GUI. The cipher folder contains a collection of basic ciphers that support encryption and decryption, some with brute-force decryption. The AoC2020 folder contains my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code challenge, which can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/
