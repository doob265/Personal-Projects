# Personal-Projects
A collection of my personal projects. 
There are currently three programs available to view:
cipher.java, which contains encryption and decryption for a variety of ciphers (topWords.txt goes with this program), 
baseball.java, which runs a simulation of a baseball game,
and gameDemo.c, which plays the first level of an RPG style game. The text file, saves.txt, goes with the game.
